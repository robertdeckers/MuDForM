# MuDForM
This repository contains the publicly available documents for MuDForM (Multi-Domain Formalization Method):
- the MuDForM method definition, which describes the modeling concepts, the method flow in terms of steps and guidelines, and the viewpoints. IT also explains how the method is constructed based on cognitive aspects and using some powerful construction patterns. 
- A zip file with the webversion of the MuDForM definition.
- Paper about the methodical conversion of text to models, accepted at PoEM 2022
- Paper about model-based feature specifications, published in Journal of Software evolution and process.
- Systematic literature review on domain-oriented specification techniques: https://github.com/robertdeckers/SLR-Domain-oriented-specification-techniques published in the Journal of Systems and Software.
- Two positioning papers (which are not published): Towards a Human Centric Development method, and Towards a Cognition-centric Development method.
- From cognitive science literature to method definition: A spreadsheet that identifies concepts from cognitive sciences, linguistics, and philosophy, and their implications for the definition of MuDForM. This is the dataset for the Thesis chapter on reflection from cognition perspective.
- Layman talk Robert Deckers.pptx. Presentation for laymen about the thesis of Robert Deckers, given at his PhD ceremony.
- PhD_Thesis_The_Smallest_Software_Particle_final_version: the thesis as published.
- Thesis cover.
- A podcast on the engineering of MuDForM; the main principles and how it is made cognition-based (generated with Notebook LM).
